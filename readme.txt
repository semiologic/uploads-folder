Changes your uploads subfolders to more natural paths that are unique to posts and pages.


== Description ==

The Uploads Folder plugin for WordPress changes your uploads' subfolders to a more natural yyyy/mm/post-slug for posts (based on the post's date rather than the current date), and page-slug/subpage-slug for static pages (based on the page's position in the hierarchy).
